Compile Cython

  [Prerequisite]
        Python 3.5 (or newer)
        Numpy
        Cython https://cython.org
        
        
        
        if you don't have numpy or Cython
        
        $ pip install --upgrade numpy Cython
    
  [Build]
    
        $ python3 setup.py build_ext -b ./src/mqc/el_prop

Test Run

  Shin-Metiu model and dftb+ ssr binary files are included in this package so that users can test UNI-xMD program. 

  [Shin-Metiu model]
    
     ** Set up qm program directory
        
        Change 'qm_path' argument in run_shin_metiu.py file to shin-metiu model BO calculation binary path,
        i.e. qm_path = "[unixmd_directory]/qm_binary/shin_metiu_binary/". 
     
     ** Run program 
        
        $ python3 run_shin_metiu.py
    
  [c2h4 dynamics using dftb-ssr]
        
     ** Set up environment variables for dftb+ ssr program
        
        $ export PYTHONPATH=[unixmd_directory]/qm_binary/dftb_plus_binary/dptools/build/lib:$PYTHONPATH
        $ export PATH=[unixmd_directory]/qm_binary/dftb_plus_binary/dptools/bin:$PATH
     
     ** Set up qm program directory
        
        Change 'qm_path' argument in run_ssr.py file to dftb binary path,
        i.e. qm_path = "[unixmd_directory]/qm_binary/dftb_plus_binary/".
        
     ** Run program
        
        $ python3 run_ssr.py
        
        
     !! All [unixmd_directory] must be given in absolute path !!
