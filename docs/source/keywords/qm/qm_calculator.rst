The propagation of molecular dynamics needs the information about potential enrgy surfaces.
The object for QM calculator should be constructed in UNI-xMD to evaluate the energies,
forces and nonadiabatic couplings. UNI-xMD interfaces with followings in current version.

- Columbus, DFTB+, Gaussian09, Molpro, QChem, TeraChem, Turbomole, Model system

Only some methods support with QM interface of UNI-xMD in current version.
If you want to add other methods such as CASPT2, see "Do It yourself" section.
The QM interfacings in UNI-xMD proceed with **get_data** method in each object.
Detailed explanation of **get_data** method is given in *modules* section.

**Ex.** Making a QM object with CASSCF method of Molpro program

.. code-block:: python

   import qm

   qm = qm.molpro.CASSCF(molecule=mol, basis_set="6-31G", memory="500m", \
       active_elec=2, active_orb=2, cpscf_grad_tol=1E-7, \
       qm_path="/opt/molpro2015.1/bin/", nthreads=1, version=2015.1)
